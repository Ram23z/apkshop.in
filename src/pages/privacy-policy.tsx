    <h3><strong>Game Distributors<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>On Apkshop, we offer Games from third-party game distributors which process your Personal Data. As also explained
        in the general information part, in that case you will play the game in the third-party game developer’s
        environment over which the third party is in control. It is the third-party game distributors that processes
        your data when you play their game and who should therefore obtain your valid consent. We only receive
        anonymized statistics and revenue reports from third-party game distributors.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>We therefore advise you to check the privacy policies of any such game distributor before starting the
        game.<br /><br /></p>
    <h3><strong>Advertising<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>On our Website, we show advertising from different advertising companies. These adverts can be personalized or
        non-personal content related ads. In order to show you personalized ads and only if you have provided your
        consent, we will share your Personal Data (your IP address, advertising identifiers and the information that you
        have provided your consent for personalized ads) through our advertising platform provider with third-party
        advertisers and ad networks.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>We also use this information to measure how effective these ads are. In our consent pop-up which will be shown to
        you the first time you enter our Website, you can choose from which advertising company you would like to
        receive personalised ads or choose not to accept receiving personalised ads at all. You can adjust your
        preferences at any time in your privacy settings. If you choose not to receive personalised ads at all, we will
        still show you ads, but they may not reflect your interests as those ads will be content specific and not user
        specific.<br /><br /></p>
    <h1><strong>Data Management Platform<br /><br /></strong></h1>
    <p>Based on your consent, we process your Personal Data to show you relevant games and ads, based on the information
        about the games you are playing on our Website. For this purpose, your device information, IP address and
        information about the category of the game you played is collected and sent to an external data management
        platform provider.<br /><br /></p>
    <h3><strong>Rating Function<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>You can rate the games on our Website, by choosing a thumbs up or thumbs down icon. It is in our legitimate
        interest to provide our users an overview which games are most popular and best rated. When you click on a
        rating button, we will store the aggregated voting data. The result of all the submitted ratings is used to
        generate a score between 1 and 5 for each game. In addition, a local text file will be stored to prevent
        multiple ratings for the same game. We will store this data in your browser’s local storage and we will not
        share this data with other partners.<br /><br /></p>
    <h3><strong>Leaderboards<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>We also offer leaderboards to facilitate earning badges that show achieved milestones on the website and to
        compare these achievements with other players. For providing and organising leaderboards we collect user ID,
        username, avatar, time played per game and date and time. Players are publicly visible on leaderboards as long
        as their accounts exist. This process is based on the performance of a contract.<br /><br /></p>
    <h3><strong>Queries, Comments, or Complaints<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or complaints about this Privacy Notice, please feel free to contact us. If
        you believe we have not complied with our obligations under applicable data protection laws and regulations, you
        can lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority, for example, the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens
        in the Netherlands.<br /><br /></p>
    <h3><strong>How Often do We Update This Privacy Notice?<br /><br /></strong></h3>
    <p>We regularly review and update this Privacy Notice. When there is an important change that will have a relevant
        impact on the processing of your Personal Data, we will inform you by email if we have your email address. If we
        do not have your email address, for example because you did not create an account, we will inform you with a
        banner on our Website.<br /><br /></p>
